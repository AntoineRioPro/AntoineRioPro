        <h2>Semester of studies in Seoul, South-Korea</h2>
        <span class="text">
            From January 2021 to June 2021 I studied in EWHA University, one of the most known of South-Korea.
            There I followed courses in english in classes of up to 50 students, with almost all of them being korean.
            I lived there on the campus and discovered the culture and way of living there.
            I made some new friendships with people from all around the world.
            I perfected my english, both written and talked.
