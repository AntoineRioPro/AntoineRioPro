        <h2>Story of the project</h2>
        <span class="text">
            During my holidays, I was thinking of programming a bit in order to discover new features.
            The idea was to build an application with JavaScript.
            What would do the app was decided after talking with my father that explained to me how fastidious it was to download all the images from a webpage.

            Then the idea was here so first thing was to get the informations about a page and get all the images from it.
            For this purpose I used axios as it was one that I had used previously in exercises at school.
            Most of the things worked fine from the go. I found myself with an object I constructed that was filled with images address.

            The part to download the image was a bit harder as I couldn't find a really working library that answered my needs.
            But after many tries and a lot of search on the internet I was able to make it work.

            At this point before starting the frontend, I decided to make available the ability to scrap several pages and put them in the same object stored by pages.
            A little bit of refactoring and I was ready to start the frontend, which was the most interesting part for me.

            I used electron to build my application as it seemed to be the easiest and I had briefly used it before for a school project.
            As I wanted a dynamic interface I started working on React. I was really wrong as React and electron working together was already something to implement but React would never allow the interaction with the local files.
            Also React was preventing from getting the pages as it was blocked most of the time by the website itself.

            That's when I discovered dynamic HTML programming. I reconstructed all the frontend, it was way easier with this new implementation.
            The app as it is today is this one.

        <h2>Explaination of the project</h2>
        <span class="text">
            <img src="https://antoineriopro.github.io/AntoineRioPro/Images/ScrapPic_base.JPG" alt="">
            I tried to make the interface as self explanatory as possible.
            Simply past the url of the page to scrap in the area, then click on scrap.
            After some seconds you should see the list of the images appearing one after the other.
            If there are some that don't appear, that's because that image is protected from being downloaded.
            You can remove any image you want by just clicking on it. A button "delete" should appear.
            <img src="https://antoineriopro.github.io/AntoineRioPro/Images/ScrapPic_example.JPG" alt="">
            If you need any other page to scrap just redo the operations from the start and the new images will appear at the bottom.

            When you are satified with the selection just click the download button at the top.
            As displayed, all the images were downloaded then to your download folder in an Image folder.
            Each page will have its own folder containing the images.
