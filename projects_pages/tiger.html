        <h2>Story of the project</h2>
        <span class="text">
            This project was a school project but I will talk about it here as it was an important one for me.

            This project's objective is to implement a compiler for an unused language, Tiger.
            This language was inspired by the book "Modern Compiler Implementation" by Andrew Appel.
            The objective is to explore every parts of a compiler program.
            
            As it would take way too much time to do it from scratch, this project is more of a project that is developed year after year at the school.
            The project for us students of third year was to fill in the blanks, where some parts of the code were removed from the reference.
            Then we had to both understand the different parts of the project to implement them right, but also understand all the code already existent to match our production with it.
            In this way it seemed like working on a really big project, where we were not only us 4 working, but a huge team was working and we just had parts of it to do.
